I am a CS PhD student and a research assistant at the University of Maryland, College Park. I am a member of the Intelligent Assistive Machines lab and [HCI lab](https://hcil.umd.edu). Under supervision of [Dr. Hernisa Kacorri](https://terpconnect.umd.edu/~hernisa/)I do research at the intersection of AI and Accessibility. Currently I am understang how non-expert users interact with AI, and how can these interactions, such as training a machine learning model, be made more effective. Prior to this my research at the Center for Advanced Transportation Technology ([CATT](https://www.cattlab.umd.edu)) involved technologies involving blind users and navigation.

Before joining the PhD program at UMD, I spent a semester as an HCI master student at the [Polytechnic University of Madrid](https://www.upm.es/internacional) where I did several HCI related projects and courses. I hold a Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from Amirkabir University of Technology in Tehran, Iran, where I passed several CS related fundamental courses and projects.
Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
